## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The vehicle length and ground clearence (as well as the intercept) provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. Thier p-values were below .05, enough to reject the null hypothesis. As seen below, signified with ***

The slope of the linear model is considered not to be zero because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, much smaller than .05 (our assumed significance level).



Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
